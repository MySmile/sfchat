        <h2><a id="Does-SFChat-saves-chat-history-on-the-server">Does SFChat saves chat history on the server?</a></h2>
        <p>
            SFChat does NOT save chat history on a server. SFChat removes message from server after delivery them to addresser.
            Moreover after 24 hours chat automatically remove all data. So undelivered messages is saved only 24 hours.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a id="How-long-current-chat-is-kept-active">How long current chat is kept active?</a></h2>
        <p>
            Each chat is active 24 hours. Such limitation increases security. 
            For instance if SFChat was not closed.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a id="How-is-SFChat-work">How is SFChat work?</a></h2>
        <p>
            After push "create chat" button new chat is created with unique "code".
            Such "code" is using to join one and only one participant to chat. 
            So after "code" is used then chat is ready to communicate. 
            Each new message were deleted from SFChat server after it was delivered to addresser. 
            After finish conversation it is strongly recommended to close chat using "close icon" on the right top corner of chat page. 
        </p>
        
        <h2><a id="What-is-code">What is "code"?</a></h2>
        <p>
            Code is a unique chat identifier. Such code can not be used along to get access to chat.
            It is like email address or car number.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a id="What-would-be-happen-when-code-has-been-stolen">What would be happen when "code" has been stolen?</a></h2>
        <p>
            Lest's consider two situation. The first when "code" is used by malicious user before "code" was applied to join chat.
            The second when "code" is used for connection to chat after they was used by right person. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            For the first situation chat was connected to wrong person. 
            Therefore correct user will be refused to use "code" because it has been already applied.
            So to prevent share information with wrong person it is better to start talk with several questions to be sure that you are speaking
            with the known person.    
        </p>  
        <p>
            In the second case malicious user can not to join to chat because of limitation of two person in one chat.
        </p>
              
        <h2><a id="Does-close-browser-or-tab-mean-that-chat-is-closed">Does close browser or tab mean that chat is closed?</a></h2>
        <p>
            No, chat is not closed. But it will be closed automatically after 24 hours since creation time.
            However 'code' can not be used to join to chat again, other chat participant does not obtain any messages that browser was closed.
            Therefore it is better to always use "close icon" to exit from chat.
        </p>
