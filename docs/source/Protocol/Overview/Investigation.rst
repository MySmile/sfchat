There are two most famous chat protocols: `XMPP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP/>`_ (Extensible Messaging and 
Presence Protocol) and `IRC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat/>`_ (Internet Relay Chat). All that 
protocols are complicated and illustrate how interlocutors connect with each other by using pull of servers with secure 
and safe way. They are solved multi users and multi server collisions. SFChat does not has such problems because only 
one server and only two users are involved to message change process. Therefore itâ€™s efficient to create new protocol 
for SFChat.
